# Coffee Review

This repository is for recording and reviewing coffee tasting sessions.

## Project Purpose

This project aims to create a comprehensive system for logging coffee flavors, based on professional cupping standards like those from the SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) and Coffee Review. It is designed to be useful for everyone from beginners to coffee professionals.

The system includes detailed categories for evaluation:
-   **Aroma:** Dry and wet fragrance
-   **Flavor:** The main taste profile
-   **Aftertaste:** The lingering flavors
-   **Acidity:** The brightness and character of the acidity
-   **Sweetness:** The level and type of sweetness
-   **Mouthfeel/Body:** The texture and weight of the coffee on the palate
-   **Balance:** The harmony of all the flavor components
-   **Overall Impression & Defects:** A summary of the coffee and any negative qualities.

For a more detailed breakdown of the planned features and evaluation criteria, please see [purpose.md](purpose.md) and [口感.md](口感.md).

## Using GitHub Pages

You can use GitHub Pages to create a simple, viewable website for your coffee reviews. The `index.html` in this repository is a starting point.

To set up GitHub Pages:
1.  Go to your repository on GitHub.
2.  Click on the "Settings" tab.
3.  In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".
4.  Under "Build and deployment", for the "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
5.  Under "Branch", select `main` (or your default branch) and `/ (root)` folder, then click "Save".
6.  Your site will be published at an address like `https://sean2249.github.io/coffee-review/`.

You can edit the `index.html` file to add your reviews and they will appear on your new website.
